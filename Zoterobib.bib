  abstract = {The increasing number of crashes occurring in work zones has received considerable attention in recent years. Previous studies have mainly focused on associations between work zone configurations and crash occurrence. Although identification of associational relations helps us understand how work zones co-exist with crashes, it does not provide interventional guidelines necessary to improve safety of work zone operations. In this paper, a causal inference model based on the potential outcome framework is proposed to rigorously infer the causal effects of work zone presence on crash risks under various work zone configurations, along with robustness tests. In developing such a causal model, three research gaps are identified and addressed: (1) potential confounding bias due to unobservable roadway characteristics; (2) potential bias caused by unobserved variables in multisource data; and (3) lack of actually observed traffic data and weather information at the exact time when a crash occurred and lack of large-scale high-granular data. The proposed methodology is applied to 5,006 work zones in Pennsylvania from 2015 to 2017, and the results are validated via a series of robustness tests. The results show that the causal effect of a work zone on crash occurrence is significantly positive, especially on roadways with high traffic volumes, on long-distance work zones, and work zones conducted during daytime. It appears that conducting work zones during nighttime with the current deployment strategies on Pennsylvania state roads does not necessarily increase crash risks, but a work zone significantly increases crash risks during day time.},

  abstract = {Numerous evaluation studies have been conducted on a variety of road safety measures. However, the issue of treatment heterogeneity, defined as the variation in treatment effects, has rarely been investigated before. This paper contributes to the literature by introducing generalized random forests (GRF) for estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in road safety analysis. GRF has high functional flexibility and is able to search for complex treatment heterogeneity. We first perform a series of simulation experiments to compare GRF with three causal methods that have been used in road safety studies, i.e., outcome regression method, propensity score method, and doubly robust estimation method. The simulation results suggest that GRF is superior to these three methods in terms of model specification, especially with the existence of nonlinearity and nonadditivity. On the other hand, a large dataset is required for accurate GRF estimation. Then we conduct a case study on the UK's speed camera program. Our results indicate significant reductions in the number of road accidents at speed camera sites. And the heterogeneity in treatment effects is found to be statistically significant. We further consider the associations between the baseline accident records, traffic volume, local socio-economic characteristics, and the safety effects of speed cameras. In general, the effect of speed cameras is larger at the sites with more baseline accident records, higher traffic volume, and in more densely-populated and deprived areas. Several policy suggestions are provided based on these findings. The evaluation of HTEs likely offers more comprehensive information to local authorities and policy makers, and improves the performance of speed camera programs. Moreover, GRF can be a promising approach for revealing treatment effect heterogeneity in road safety analysis.},

  abstract = {Work zones are temporary traffic control zones that can potentially cause safety problems. Maintaining safety, while implementing necessary changes on roadways, is an important challenge traffic engineers and researchers have to confront. In this study, the risk factors in work zone safety evaluation were identified through the estimation of a crash frequency (CF) model. Measurement errors in explanatory variables of a CF model can lead to unreliable estimates of certain parameters. Among these, work zone length raises a major concern in this analysis because it may change as the construction schedule progresses generally without being properly documented. This paper proposes an improved modeling and estimation approach that involves the use of a measurement error (ME) model integrated with the traditional negative binomial (NB) model. The proposed approach was compared with the traditional NB approach. Both models were estimated using a large dataset that consists of 60 work zones in New Jersey. Results showed that the proposed improved approach outperformed the traditional approach in terms of goodness-of-fit statistics. Moreover it is shown that the use of the traditional NB approach in this context can lead to the overestimation of the effect of work zone length on the crash occurrence.},

  abstract = {Work zones in the United States have approximately 700 traffic-related fatalities, 24\hphantom{,}000 injury crashes, and 52\hphantom{,}000 non-injury crashes every year. Due to future highway reconstruction needs, work zones are likely to increase in number, duration, and length. This study focuses on analyzing the effect of work zone duration mainly due to its policy-sensitivity. To do so, we created a unique dataset of California freeway work zones that included crash data (crash frequency and injury severity), road inventory data (average daily traffic (ADT) and urban/rural character), and work zone related data (duration, length, and location). Then, we investigated crash rates and crash frequencies in the pre-work zone and during-work zone periods. For the freeway work zones investigated in this study, the total crash rate in the during-work zone period was 21.5\% higher (0.79 crashes per million vehicle kilometer (MVKM)) than the pre-work zone period (0.65 crashes per MVKM). Compared with the pre-work zone period, the increase in non-injury and injury crash rates in the during-work zone period was 23.8\% and 17.3\%, respectively. Next, crash frequencies were investigated using negative binomial models, which showed that frequencies increased with increasing work zone duration, length, and average daily traffic. The important finding is that after controlling for various factors, longer work zone duration significantly increases both injury and non-injury crash frequencies. The implications of the study findings are discussed in the paper.},

  abstract = {Construction and maintenance work zones have traditionally been hazardous locations within the highway environment. Studies show that the accident rates during road construction are generally higher than during periods of regular traffic operations. The increase in the number of crashes may be attributed to (a) general disruption to the flowing traffic due to sudden discontinuities caused by closed lanes, (b) improper lane merging maneuvers, (c) the presence of heavy construction equipment within the work area, (d) inappropriate use of traffic control devices, and (e) poor traffic management. Research was conducted to develop regression models predicting the expected number of crashes at work zones on rural, two-lane freeway segments. Crashes on approaches to work zones and those inside the work zones were analyzed separately. For developing these models, an extensive database was obtained, including freeway data, crash data, and work zone characteristics. Negative binomial models were developed with average daily traffic, the length of the work zones, and the duration of the work projects as exposure-to-risk variables. The cost of the various work projects was found to be a good substitute for some of the exposure-to-risk variables. The investigated variables included the number of on and off ramps, both on approaches and inside the work zones; the type of work; and the intensity of the road work involved. The models may be used to evaluate beforehand the expected number of crashes on the work zone, given the work zone characteristics.},

Furthermore the analysis has shown that all layout configurations that involve a crossover are very critical for safety: the highest CMFs are observed for the configurations with only a partial diversion of traffic to the opposite carriageway (with part of the traffic remaining in the ordinary flow direction and part travelling in the opposite carriageway).},

  abstract = {Many studies have been conducted to estimate the traffic safety impacts of roadway construction. Overall, the results of the analyses have varied widely, a variance traditionally attributed to site-to-site and project-to-project differences. In this paper, researchers describe an effort to use empirical Bayesian (EB) techniques to develop crash modification factors (CMFs for construction zones on the basis of temporal factors). Specifically, separate CMFs were estimated for various conditions, including time-of-day (e.g., daytime, nighttime), work status (e.g., activity, inactivity), and temporary traffic control (e.g., lane closure, no lane closure). Daily project inspector diaries from 64 freeway construction projects in four states were analyzed to determine hours of work, hours and locations of temporary lane closures, and the number of travel lanes closed during each work period. Researchers used EB methods in a before-during study design to investigate the safety impacts of the work zone conditions. Work activities that required the temporary closure of one or more travel lanes resulted in the largest CMFs (i.e., the largest increases in crashes), followed by periods of work activity that did not require a lane closure (i.e., work was occurring in the median or beyond the edge of the travel lanes). The lowest increase in crashes occurred during periods when work was not occurring at a project. The CMFs during work activity did not vary significantly between daytime and nighttime conditions when there was a lane closure. The results suggest that EB methods can be useful in assessing temporal factors that influence road safety.},
